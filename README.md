# HackathonMar21-2024 - Theme: Safety in Visual AI** 

# Problem

**Target audience:** Elderly with memory loss or early dementia

**Goal:** Enable independent living through spatial awareness technology

**Key challenge:** Memory issues make locating everyday items and remembering simple tasks difficult and can compromise safety

## Why this is important

- About 40% of people aged 65 or older have age-associated memory impairment‚Äîin the United States, about 16 million people. Only about 1% of them will progress to dementia each year. *(National Institute on Aging, 2004)*
- 77 percent of adults 50 and older want to remain in their homes for the long term‚Äîa number that has been consistent for more than a decade. *(AARP, 2021)*
