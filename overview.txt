Below is a concise overview that covers:
	1.	Voxel51 Essentials
	2.	Step-by-Step Project Structure
	3.	Short “Prompt Segments” for you to reference later.

Use these segments to request more detail from me when you need it (e.g., “Tell me more about Step 2”). That way, you’ll have a clear roadmap.

1. Voxel51 Essentials

What It Is:
Voxel51 offers tools to manage and analyze large computer vision datasets. It helps you:
	•	Visualize images or videos and their labels.
	•	Annotate or refine labels.
	•	Filter, search, and organize your data efficiently.
	•	Inspect model outputs and compare results across experiments.

Why It Matters:
	•	You can quickly see where your model is failing or succeeding.
	•	It speeds up iteration by providing an intuitive way to handle large, complex datasets.

2. Project Structure (Short Overview)

Step 1: Define the Problem
	•	Focus on a specific elderly action recognition task (e.g., detecting subtle actions or anomalies).
	•	Goal: Clarify the main objective (e.g., “Identify fall vs. normal activity with minimal false alarms.”)

Step 2: Set Up Environment
	•	Tools: Python, PyTorch/TensorFlow, Voxel51 platform.
	•	Install required packages and ensure your environment can run basic ML code.

Step 3: Gather & Explore Data
	•	Import into Voxel51 to label, filter, or augment.
	•	Explore data distribution: how many samples per class, video length, etc.

Step 4: Pre-Processing & Labeling
	•	Clean & Prepare: Use Voxel51 to remove duplicates, handle missing labels.
	•	Annotate or refine existing labels (e.g., bounding boxes, action segments).

Step 5: Model Selection & Training
	•	Transfer Learning: Pick a pre-trained architecture (e.g., I3D, SlowFast).
	•	Train/Fine-Tune: Use the cleaned data to fine-tune for elderly ADLs.

Step 6: Evaluation & Analysis
	•	Metrics: Accuracy, F1-score, confusion matrix.
	•	Voxel51 Insights: Visualize misclassifications and compare performance across experiments.

Step 7: Iterate & Refine
	•	Adjust hyperparameters, augment data, or tweak the model.
	•	Repeat until you see consistent improvements.

Step 8: Deploy or Demo
	•	Integration: Show how your solution could run on real-time video or a simple UI.
	•	Present final results at the hackathon.

3. Short Prompt Segments

Use these to get deeper explanations when you’re ready:
	1.	“Tell me more about Voxel51’s core features.”
	2.	“How do I set up my environment for this hackathon?”
	3.	“What’s the best way to explore data in Voxel51?”
	4.	“How do I handle labeling and annotation with Voxel51?”
	5.	“Explain model selection and training strategies for elderly action recognition.”
	6.	“How do I evaluate my model with Voxel51’s tools?”
	7.	“What are some best practices for iteration and refining the model?”
	8.	“Give me tips on presenting my final solution.”

Final Note

This structure keeps you on track:
	1.	Start simple (problem definition).
	2.	Set up the environment.
	3.	Gather data, label it, and explore it using Voxel51.
	4.	Choose a model, train it, then analyze performance with Voxel51’s visualization.
	5.	Iterate and refine until you have a solution worth demoing.

Feel free to ask for more detail on any step by referencing the corresponding prompt segment. Good luck!
