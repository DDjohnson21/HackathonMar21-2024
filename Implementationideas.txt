Simplest/Cheapest Option - SmartGlasses:
    Item finding:
        -If you lose an item anywhere, the glasses will take into account the location it was last seen. 
        When you ask it, it will tell you were it was.
    Alert emergency contacts:
        - The model will take into account the motion detection of SmartGlasses, and if it detects an individual falling or dizzyness 
        it will alert an emergency contact
        - If the model notices that an individual took medication at a certain time it will keep account of it 
        and if the individual forgets and takes the medication again within a certain time frame it will alert an emergency contact
        for potential overdose.
    Alert individual:
        - An individual can set a reminder for some kind of medication they should be taking at a certain time. If the model sees the
        medication being consumed it will not say anything, but if a set amount of time passes from the when the medication should have 
        been consumed it will send a reminder.
